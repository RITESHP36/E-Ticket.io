<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -->
## Additional Information

The Digital Token Generation and Validation website is built to simplify and secure event entry processes through digital token management. Here are the key features and functionalities:

1. **Frontend Development**: Created using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS, the frontend offers a seamless and interactive user experience. The intuitive design ensures users can easily navigate and understand the token generation and validation process.

2. **Backend Development**: Supabase is utilized for the backend, managing the user database effectively. Each user is assigned a unique UUID, ensuring secure and reliable identification.

3. **Email Communication**: Google Sheets is integrated for mail merge functionality, allowing for efficient and personalized email communication with event attendees. This integration simplifies the process of sending out event-related information and updates.

4. **QR-Based Authentication**: To enhance security and efficiency, a QR-based authentication system is implemented. This system not only reduces the waiting time for users by 50% but also eliminates the need for physical tokens, resolving redundancy issues and making the process more eco-friendly.

5. **User Management**: The platform allows event organizers to manage user data and event details efficiently. The use of Supabase ensures that all data is handled securely and can be accessed and managed in real-time.

6. **Real-Time Updates**: With the integration of modern web technologies, the platform supports real-time updates, ensuring that users and organizers have the most current information at their fingertips.
